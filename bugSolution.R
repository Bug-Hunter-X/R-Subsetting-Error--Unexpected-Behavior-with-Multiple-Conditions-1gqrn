```r
#Corrected Code
data <- data.frame(A = c(1, 2, 3), B = c(4, 5, 6))

#The issue was that the original code was not properly handling vector recycling. 
#To correct it, ensure the logical conditions operate element-wise.  Using parentheses can sometimes solve this
subsetted_data <- data[(data$A > 1) & (data$B < 6), ] 

#Alternative approach using dplyr
library(dplyr)
subsetted_data <- data %>% filter(A > 1 & B < 6)
```
